## React for Beginners â€“ 001_react-for-beginners

Wes Bos released the updated version of his [React course](https://reactforbeginners.com/) today. A couple years ago, I followed along with the original version of the course. As the title suggests, it's intended for beginners and fairly basic but completely up-to-date, so I thought it would be a good way to kick off this review. I also want to use it as practice for getting more up to speed with with Jest and Enzyme, so I'll be writing tests and reading docs as I go.
